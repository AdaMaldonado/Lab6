# Lab6
CISC 3130 Lab Assignment 6

This repository was created to display my source code and output text file of the sixth lab assignment in CISC 3130. The assignment for the course was to compute the letter grade for the course itself by inputing the grades for each assignment and computing the final score so far from the class.

# Installation
The following information will instruct the user on how to run my program and as well describe the technologies I used.

## Dependencies/Technologies
* Java 8 IDE (Netbeans 8.2) https://netbeans.org/downloads/8.2/rc/

Netbeans is a free and open source integrated development environment (IDE) for Java. It runs on Windows, macOS, Linux and Solaris operating systems. I used this IDE to create/compile/run this program.

## Setup/Instructions
These are the steps to compile Lab6.java and run the program Lab6. Source code is found in the src file under Lab6. For how to use command line workflow such as terminal:

1. Sign up for a Github account if you don't have one. Set up your SSH keys with github.
2. Clone this repository to your machine to get a copy.
3. Move into the project's root directory with cd lab6
4. Move again into the subdirectory lab6 using the command cd lab6
5. Compile the java file using the java compiler command javac Lab6.java
6. Run the compiled java program with java command java Lab6

The output should be the same as the output text file output.txt

## Folder Structure
* Source code is saved into the lab6 folder.
* Output is called output.txt which is seen when opening the Lab6 folder.
